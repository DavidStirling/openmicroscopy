## omero.properties
## ----------------
##
## DO NOT EDIT!
##
##
## Any of these properties can be altered by using bin/omero config. MODIFYING
## THIS FILE DOES NOT ALTER SERVER BEHAVIOR. It solely defines the defaults
## at compile time!
##
## For an overview of these properties, see
## https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/sysadmins/config.html
##
## Properties marked with "DEVELOPMENT" should not be used in production.

# Comma separated list of Ice transports available to clients. The default
# value ("ssl,tcp") restricts Ice to using the omero.ports.ssl and omero.ports.tcp
# configuration properties. Restricting to "ssl" will prevent all non-encrypted
# connections to the OMERO server.
#
# Additionally, there are two experimental values: "ws" and "wss" for unecrypted
# and encrypted, respectively. The ports that #are opened are controlled by the
# omero.ports.ws and omero.ports.wss configuration properties. To enable all
# possible protocols use: "ssl,tcp,wss,ws". When using websockets behind a web
# server like nginx, additional configuration may be needed.
omero.client.icetransports=ssl,tcp

# The prefix to apply to all port numbers (SSL, TCP, registry) used by the
# server
omero.ports.prefix=

# The Glacier2 SSL port number to use
omero.ports.ssl=4064

# The Glacier2 TCP port number to use (unencrytped)
omero.ports.tcp=4063

# DEVELOPMENT
# The Glacier2 WSS port number to use
omero.ports.wss=4066

# DEVELOPMENT
# The Glacier2 WS port number to use (unecrypted)
omero.ports.ws=4065

# The IceGrid registry port number to use
omero.ports.registry=4061

## JVM configuration
##
## Note: changes to the omero.jvmcfg properties
## will *not* be reflected in the compiled server
## since they are defined in a Python file.
#############################################
## (For documentation only)
# Memory strategy which will be used by default.
# Options include: percent, manual
omero.jvmcfg.strategy=percent

## (For documentation only)
# Explicit value for the `-Xmx` argument, e.g.
# "1g"
omero.jvmcfg.heap_size=

## (For documentation only)
# Explicit value for the MaxPermSize argument
# to the JVM, e.g. "500M". Ignored for Java8+
omero.jvmcfg.perm_gen=

## (For documentation only)
# Toggles on or off heap dumps on OOMs. Default is "off".
# The special value "tmp" will create the heap dumps in
# your temp directory.
omero.jvmcfg.heap_dump=

## (For documentation only)
# Used only by the percent strategy. An integer between 0
# and 100 which is the percent of active memory that will
# be used by the service.
omero.jvmcfg.percent=

## (For documentation only)
# Contains other parameters which should be passed to the
# JVM. The value of "append" is treated as if it were on
# the command line so will be separated on whitespace.
# For example, '-XX:-PrintGC -XX:+UseCompressedOops' would
# results in two new arguments.
# Note that when using `config set` from the command line
# one may need to give a prior `--` option to prevent a value
# starting with `-` from already being parsed as an option,
# and values may need quoting to prevent whitespace or other
# significant characters from being interpreted prematurely.

omero.jvmcfg.append=

## (For documentation only)
# Manual override of the total system memory that
# OMERO will *think* is present on the local OS (MB).
# If unset, an attempt will be made to detect the actual
# amount: first by using the Python library `psutil` and
# if that is not installed, by running a Java tool. If
# neither works, 4.0GB is assumed.
omero.jvmcfg.system_memory=

## (For documentation only)
# Suggestion for strategies as to the minimum memory
# that they will use for calculating JVM settings (MB).
omero.jvmcfg.min_system_memory=3414

## (For documentation only)
# Suggestion for strategies as to the maximum memory
# that they will use for calculating JVM settings (MB).
omero.jvmcfg.max_system_memory=48000

## Ice overrides
##
## Though not used directly by OMERO, a number
## of properties prefixed with "Ice.*" will
## alter the behavior of the OMERO runtime
## by configuring the Ice communicators. For a
## full listing see:

##   http://doc.zeroc.com/display/Ice/Property+Reference
## For more information see
## https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/omero/sysadmins/troubleshooting.html#server-fails-to-start

# Disable IPv6 by setting to 0. Only needed in
# certain situations.
